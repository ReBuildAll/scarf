Scarf
=====
Scarf is security audit, access and action logging framework for .NET

With scarf, you can log audit events, access events and actions performed by the user. You simply add attributes to your MVC action methods to initiate logging.

Logs are saved in a database or in files. They contain a lot of information beyond what has happened: HTTP Server headers, query strings variables, POST field values, cookies and even MVC model state values.
